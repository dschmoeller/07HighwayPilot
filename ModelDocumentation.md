# Project 7: Path Planning



## **Project Goals: **

* Safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic
* The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit
* The car should pass slower traffic when possible
* The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost
* The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway
* The car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3
